# Coding exercises for Senior Software Engineer with ReactJS

## Exercise 1: React Component Design

**Task**: Design a reusable DataTable React component that displays data in a tabular format. The component should be able to:

- Take an array of objects as a prop, where each object represents a row in the table.
- Accept another prop that defines the columns for the table. Each column definition should include the key of the data in the objects and a label for the column header.
- Optionally, sort the data based on a specified column when clicked.

**Requirements**:

- Use functional components and hooks.
- Ensure the component is efficient and re-renders only when necessary.
- Implement basic styling to distinguish between headers and rows.
- (Bonus) Add pagination support with a configurable number of rows per page.
